## Week 12 review:
### What did we work on?
We worked on our prototype and its blades. 
### What decisions were made?
A vertical wind turbine is the most efficient
### What new resources did we find?
Our mentor was able to get us a lot of the materials for the prototype
### What new issues were discovered?
It's hard to test wind turbines cause there isnâ€™t always easy access to wind.
### What went well?
The vertical aspect of the blades was easy to manufacture
### What was difficult?
The fact that none of our screws fit at all (goober moment)
### What is our plan for next week?
To check the voltage output of the prototype to see how much we need for the full scale.

## Weeeaak firtween revev:
### What did you work on?
We finished the fan blades, and need to print them. 
### What decisions were made?
We decided to measure the output, so our mentor sent us a calculator to help us calculate volts and performance.
### What new resources did you find?
We found a turbine performance calculator and a website that explains the difference between volts and watts
### What new issues were discovered?
We need the resistor but don't have it
### What went well?
The blades CAD
### What was difficult?
Finding a time for a meeting
### What is your plan for next week?
Print wind turbine prototype
## Week 14 Review
### What did you work on?
we developed a method by which to attach our wings to the motor.
### What decisions were made?
We decided to friction fit over the screw method.
### What new resources did you find?
We found out the wings needed to be smaller to fit the 3d printer
### What new issues were discovered?
We found out that the laser cutter cuts at a slight angle. 
### What went well?
Our meeting with our mentor went well
### What was difficult?
figuring out what motor to use
### What is your plan for next week?
Print wind turbine prototype
