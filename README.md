## Bill of Materials

NONE HAHAHAHHAHHHAHAHAHAH

## Week 12 review:
### What did we work on?
We worked on our prototype and its blades. 
### What decisions were made?
A vertical wind turbine is the most efficient
### What new resources did we find?
Our mentor was able to get us a lot of the materials for the prototype
### What new issues were discovered?
It's hard to test wind turbines cause there isnâ€™t always easy access to wind.
### What went well?
The vertical aspect of the blades was easy to manufacture
### What was difficult?
The fact that none of our screws fit at all (goober moment)
### What is our plan for next week?
To check the voltage output of the prototype to see how much we need for the full scale. 
#
## Weeeaak firtween revev:
### What did you work on?
We finished the fan blades, and need to print them. 
### What decisions were made?
We decided to measure the output, so our mentor sent us a calculator to help us calculate volts and performance.
### What new resources did you find?
We found a turbine performance calculator and a website that explains the difference between volts and watts
### What new issues were discovered?
We need the resistor but don't have it
### What went well?
The blades CAD
### What was difficult?
Finding a time for a meeting
### What is your plan for next week?
Print wind turbine prototype
## Week 14 Review
### What did you work on?
we developed a method by which to attach our wings to the motor.
### What decisions were made?
We decided to friction fit over the screw method.
### What new resources did you find?
We found out the wings needed to be smaller to fit the 3d printer
### What new issues were discovered?
We found out that the laser cutter cuts at a slight angle. 
### What went well?
Our meeting with our mentor went well
### What was difficult?
figuring out what motor to use
### What is your plan for next week?
Print wind turbine prototype
## Week 15 Review
### What did you work on?
We found the correct dimensions for our attachments. 
### What decisions were made?
We stretched the screw holes out farther away to give the bolt more space.
### What new resources did you find?
We developed the attachment pieces. 
### What new issues were discovered?
The price of our print was way too much, so we brought it down. 
### What went well?
Our 3D printing for the attachment went well. 
### What was difficult?
Scaling the project back. 
### What is your plan for next week?
Build the wings together
## Week 17 Review
### What did you work on?
We finally convinced Mr. Miller to print our things finally
### What decisions were made?
We decided that fiberglass was a little too hard, therefore what we were printing is now our final.
### What new resources did you find?
We found the code for the INA260 that we are using. 
### What new issues were discovered?
3D printer wasn't working properly. 
### What went well?
Spencer's History quiz went really well and yay. 
### What was difficult?
Setting up the Raspberry Pi on the new computer. 
### What is your plan for next week?
Adjust our bolt holes. 
## Week 18 Review
### What did you work on?
We adjusted our bolt holes away from the top so we could screw them in easier.  
### What decisions were made?
Mr. Miller decided it would be really cool and funny to not print our stuff so that I guess.
### What new resources did you find?
Found the INA Library so we could use it on the Raspberry Pi. 
### What new issues were discovered?
The lack of new print for our design. 
### What went well?
Tweaking the code. 
### What was difficult?
building something we didn't have because Mr. Miller didn't print it btw. 
### What is your plan for next week?
Build our pieces up and test our motor. 
## Week 19 Review
### What did you work on?
We worked on the construction of our Wind Turbine.
### What decisions were made?
To use a different library for our INA project.
### What new resources did you find?
We found out more information about our INA from our mentor. 
### What new issues were discovered?
Skips in our motor.  
### What went well?
Our in-person mentor meeting went well. 
### What was difficult?
My Soccer tryouts for CHS
### What is your plan for next week?
Finish code.
